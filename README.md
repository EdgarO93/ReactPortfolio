## Description

This portfolio is build with React and using design features such as Boostrap framework. This is my first time building a React App,but I hope to further update this resume as I get more experience with React. I have added some new projects and I am proud to have a mix of front end and back end projects. I have a video for my Employee Tracker back-end project as it is not deployed.
